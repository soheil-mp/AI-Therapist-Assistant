## üéØ Overview

This project aims to create an AI-powered therapist assistant by fine-tuning the Llama-3.2 1B model. The assistant is designed to provide initial mental health support while clearly communicating its limitations and directing users to professional help when needed. The model is optimized to run efficiently on consumer-grade GPUs while maintaining high-quality therapeutic responses.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Empathetic responses based on CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) principles
- Privacy-focused design with local deployment options
- Clear communication of AI limitations and scope
- Professional help referral system
- Lightweight model optimized for consumer GPUs
- Quantized model support for efficient inference
- Open-source and customizable
- Regular updates and community contributions

## üíª Technical Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with 6GB VRAM (RTX 3060 recommended)
- 32GB RAM
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- 50GB free disk space
- CUDA 11.7+

## üìä Dataset

1. **Mental Health Conversations Dataset**
   - Source: [Mental Health Conversations Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mental-health-conversations)
   - ~15,000 therapeutic conversations
   - Focused on various mental health topics
   - Cleaned and annotated for quality

2. **Therapy Transcripts and Dialogues**
   - Source: [PsyQA Dataset](https://github.com/Princeton-SysML/PsyQA)
   - ~10,000 therapy conversation excerpts
   - Professionally validated responses
   - Privacy-compliant and anonymized

3. **CBT Framework Dataset**
   - Custom-curated dataset of CBT techniques
   - ~3,000 examples of CBT-based interventions
   - Includes common therapeutic scenarios
   - Validated by mental health professionals

4. **Crisis Response Dataset**
   - Specialized dataset for crisis intervention
   - ~2,000 examples of appropriate crisis responses
   - Clear escalation protocols
   - Professional referral guidelines
